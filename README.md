# Abstract
Visual images perceived by humans can be reconstructed from their brain activity. However, the visualization (externalization) of mental imagery remains a challenge. Here we proposed a novel method by incorporating recently 
and introduced the assistance of semantic information into it. Our proposed framework successfully reconstructed both seen (i.e., directly captured by the human eye) and imagined images from the brain activity. These results suggest that our framework would provide a technology for directly investigating the subjective contents of the brain.
